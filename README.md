A modern flash sale e-commerce platform built for STADVDB MCO2 with transactional and analytical database operations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- (Optional) Visual Studio Code

### Running the Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd stadvdb-mco2

# Open the frontend in browser
open frontend/index.html
```

### Alternative methods:

- Double-click `frontend/index.html` in Finder
- Use VSCode with Live Server extension
- Run `python3 -m http.server 8000` and `visit http://localhost:8000/frontend/`

### To populate data in DB:

* Alternatively, just use the data already in sample_data and olap_data.

- RUN "CREATE DATABASE <db_name>; USE <db_name>;" in mySQL workbench
- Run schema_oltp.sql in MySQL workbench. This is the main DB and replication and hot backup db.
- Right click each table in Navigator view and click Table Data Import Wizard
- Map the path to the right csv file in sample_data. Use existing data, and keep clicking Next. Data in the tables should be populated.
- Run schema_olap.sql in MySQL workbench
- Run etl.ipynb to transform oltp data to olap data in olap_data folder.
- Right click each new table in Navigator view and click Table Data Import Wizard
- Map the path to the right csv file in olap_data. Use existing data, and keep clicking Next. Data in the tables should be populated.
